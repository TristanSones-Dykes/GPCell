	abstract = {Multiple biological processes are driven by oscillatory gene expression at different time scales. Pulsatile dynamics are thought to be widespread, and single-cell live imaging of gene expression has lead to a surge of dynamic, possibly oscillatory, data for different gene networks. However, the regulation of gene expression at the level of an individual cell involves reactions between finite numbers of molecules, and this can result in inherent randomness in expression dynamics, which blurs the boundaries between aperiodic fluctuations and noisy oscillators. This underlies a new challenge to the experimentalist because neither intuition nor pre-existing methods work well for identifying oscillatory activity in noisy biological time series. Thus, there is an acute need for an objective statistical method for classifying whether an experimentally derived noisy time series is periodic. Here, we present a new data analysis method that combines mechanistic stochastic modelling with the powerful methods of non-parametric regression with Gaussian processes. Our method can distinguish oscillatory gene expression from random fluctuations of non-oscillatory expression in single-cell time series, despite peak-to-peak variability in period and amplitude of single-cell oscillations. We show that our method outperforms the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in successfully classifying cells as oscillatory or non-oscillatory in data simulated from a simple genetic oscillator model and in experimental data. Analysis of bioluminescent live-cell imaging shows a significantly greater number of oscillatory cells when luciferase is driven by a Hes1 promoter (10/19), which has previously been reported to oscillate, than the constitutive MoMuLV 5’ LTR (MMLV) promoter (0/25). The method can be applied to data from any gene network to both quantify the proportion of oscillating cells within a population and to measure the period and quality of oscillations. It is publicly available as a MATLAB package.},

	abstract = {During embryogenesis cells make fate decisions within complex tissue environments. The levels and dynamics of transcription factor expression regulate these decisions. Here, we use single cell live imaging of an endogenous HES5 reporter and absolute protein quantification to gain a dynamic view of neurogenesis in the embryonic mammalian spinal cord. We report that dividing neural progenitors show both aperiodic and periodic HES5 protein fluctuations. Mathematical modelling suggests that in progenitor cells the HES5 oscillator operates close to its bifurcation boundary where stochastic conversions between dynamics are possible. HES5 expression becomes more frequently periodic as cells transition to differentiation which, coupled with an overall decline in HES5 expression, creates a transient period of oscillations with higher fold expression change. This increases the decoding capacity of HES5 oscillations and correlates with interneuron versus motor neuron cell fate. Thus, HES5 undergoes complex changes in gene expression dynamics as cells differentiate.},

However, the existence and the role of such dynamic oscillatory expression in vivo is poorly understood. Here, we have generated a Zebrafish CRISPR knock-in Her6::venus fusion (Hes1 orthologue) to study endogenous dynamic gene expression in the embryonic hindbrain. We show that Her6 undergoes a transition from irregular, noisy, fluctuations to periodic oscillations as neurogenesis proceeds. In the absence of miR-9 input, noise in the Her6 oscillator increases and NPCs are unable to transit away from an intermediary state where they co-express progenitor and early differentiation markers. Thus, Her6 oscillations are facilitated by noise optimization mediated by miR-9 and this noise-tuning step is functionally important for cells to transition to differentiation.},

The starting point is a macroscopic description that identifies the system's elementary reactions in terms of rate laws and stoichiometries. From this formulation follows directly the stationary solution of the linear noise approximation (LNA) of the Master equation for all the components in the network. The method complements bifurcation studies of the system's parameter dependence by providing estimates of sizes, correlations, and time scales of stochastic fluctuations. We describe how the LNA can give precise system descriptions also near macroscopic instabilities by suitable variable changes and elimination of fast variables.},
