## Reproducing Previous Results

A key plot in @phillips_identifying_2017 is the ROC curve comparing the GP method to the Lomb-Scargle method. It is reproduced below, with added AUC values for both methods.

This shows that GPCell fits the same quality models as the MATLAB implementation, on MATLAB generated data. The ROC curves don't have margins on the original plot, adding them makes spotting discrepancies between the models easier.

The added AUC values give a lot of information; despite the $\sigma^2 = 0.5$ ROC for the GP method looking far worse than the others, the AUC shows us it is, quantitatively, not as dissimilar from the others as it looks.

## Performance Improvements

Figures and tables showing speed improvements (e.g., parallelisation with Joblib, simulation with numba)

Discussion on computational resources needed (RAM, CPU/GPU)

## MCMC Model

Example MCMC fits (trace plots, parameter distributions).

Show how it works on the data, performance of classification.

Discuss implications and accuracy improvements from MCMC inference.
