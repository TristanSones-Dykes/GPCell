# Results

## Reproducibility of Prior Results
ROC figures comparing your library against previous MATLAB implementation (both GP and Lomb-Scargle methods)

Explicit statistical comparison (AUC values)

## Performance Analysis
Figures and tables showing speed improvements (e.g., parallelisation with Joblib, simulation with numba)

Discussion on computational resources needed (RAM, CPU/GPU)

## MCMC Implementation
Example MCMC fits (trace plots, parameter distributions)

Discuss implications and accuracy improvements from MCMC inference

## Practical Demonstration and Extensibility
Showcase practical use-cases (example time-series, how results are interpreted)

Short code snippets demonstrating extensibility (showing actual examples using your library)
